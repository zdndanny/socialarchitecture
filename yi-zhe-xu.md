在自传中 Pieter Hintjens 说自己是一个作家，程序员和思想家，花费了几十年来建造大型软件系统和在线社区，把它们当作“有生命的系统”。 他是一位分布计算的专家，写过超过30种协议和分布式软件系统。 他于2007年创立了ZeroMQ自由软件项目，于2013年发起 edgenet 项目以建立一个完全安全，匿名的对等互联网。 他的著作包括"ZeroMQ - Messaging for Many Applications" (O'Reilly), "Code Connected", and "Culture and Empire: Digital Revolution"，"The Psychopath Code"， 以及未完成的"Scalable C". 他位于hintjens.com的博客讨论技术和数码人类学。

他强烈批评专利体系，在2005到2007年之间领导欧洲的反对软件专利运动。在他的"Digital Revolution"中写道，专利体系除了让穿了西装革履的匪徒自称 “诚实商人”之外再没有什么其它功能。

He's been a strong critic of the patent system, leading the European effort to ban software patents from 2005 to 2007. In "Digital Revolution" he writes, The patent system has no function other than to enable gangsters dressed in suits to call themselves "honest businessmen.".

His company, iMatix, provides support to the ZeroMQ market, and in this role he's traveled the world, teaching, coaching and helping others to organize successfully.

He defined the term "Social Architecture" as the process, and the product, of planning, designing, and growing an online community, and has promoted the techniques of social architecture in articles and at conferences.

In his free time he plays piano, badly. He earned his Certified Pistol Instructor badge in Waxahachie, Texas in 2012, though does not own a gun. He learned to drum with Mamady Keita in Brussels in 1998-2000, and played for fifteen years with African musicians in Belgium. He lives in Brussels with his family. He's a member of Mensa and Rotary International and spends most of his time writing and contributing to ZeroMQ and other open source projects.

We exist purely as vehicles for our genes; our consciousness, our imaginations, our creations: all these are simply manifestations of our genetically-implanted instincts for survival. We believe we exist because it makes us better replicators. There is no other reason for existence, no god, no destiny, no karma. Our lives are neither random nor controlled: choice is an illusion, but so is fate. We simply operate, like the very intelligent automatons we are. Our minds are exquisitely adapted to solving large and complex problems, the bulk of which come from our intraspecies competition with each other. Our societies are hives, built through the collaboration of thousands and millions of minds. As a species we are genetically so similar, due to near-extinction around 50,000 years ago, that we are practically clones. All our notions of "ethnicity" and "color" are as meaningful as separating people by hair patterns or toe size. Our species is incredibly successful mainly because we have managed to turn our technological prowess onto ourselves, creating a feedback loop that has not stopped since we invented fire and freed our jaws to shrink and make space for a larger brain. Finally, although we all feel unique, we are in fact designed as team players, male and female, young and old adopting clear and comfortable roles that are so inate they are universal in all human cultures. Men solve technical problems, women organize social networks. Young men learn and work, young women dance and like to look pretty. Old women gossip and old men accumulate power.
